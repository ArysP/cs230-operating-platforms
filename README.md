CS-230 Operating Platforms at SNHU

## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
Our client, The Gaming Room, came to Creative Technology Solutions seeking help in setting up an environment to expand their application, Draw It or Lose It, to multiple operating systems. Our client developed Draw It or Lose It on the Adroid OS and requested that the app be able to run on several other major OS including Windows, MacOS, Linux and Mobile devives. The app must also follow the following software requirements: 
- A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved.
- Each team will have multiple players assigned to it.
- Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.
- One instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. 
- Unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The biggest aid in working through the design document came in the form of direction. By clearly defining goals, objectives, constraints, and comparisons there was a clear path in developement always present. This led to little wasted time on uneeded features when developing code and ease in design choices. It also led to easy code review, as necessary features were clearly defined.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I found the pros and cons section of my document to be very difficult. Because of my inexperience with other operating systems I believe I relied on general knowledge to populate the chart. I went back and attempted a second rendetion of it with more detail, but even so I believe it is my weakest area that could use improvement.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Draw It or Lose It is a game where drawings are rendered at a steady rate and should be fully completed at the 30 second mark. If the guessing team did not guess by the 30 second mark, then the opposing team is offered 15 seconds to make a guess. In order to account for this, the application needed to be able to quickly access the library of photos determined by The Gaming Room. Our software design was directly influenced as we chose Microsoft and Azure for security/storage/memory/network. These are all important considerations as they directly impact the user experience, and at the end, the a smooth user experience is the most important aspect to a game application. 

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I think the software design document was a great guide and framework for software design. Most importantly I think early on in developement is establishing design constraints. This provides the overall direction and framework for the actual developement. In the future if I was tasked with designing a similar app, I would use a similar software design document to help guide me and my team.
